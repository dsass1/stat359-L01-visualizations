## Overview

The goal of this lab is to start building the skills to explore data through visualization using the `ggplot2` package in R (member of the `tidyverse`). Students will also learn to access and utilize R documentation.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L01_visualization.html`. A template is also provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L0q.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
